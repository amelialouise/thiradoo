What triggers a reaction? Men, women, kids, dogs, birds, bicycles, colors, and so on.

Do they react the same everywhere or do they only react in certain locations?

What's their threshold distance? Can they see any of their triggers at a distance and not react?

What sort of training, if any, have you done so far? This includes counter conditioning, BAT, Look at That game, and many others.

Is your dog on any medications for their reactivity? Is this something you would consider?
